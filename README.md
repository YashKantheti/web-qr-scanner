This is a web-based QR scanner that can detect possible dangerous QR codes such as file downloads, script injections. 
I'm not responsible for any failures in the detection software. This program is very basic and is no means a full proof method.
You should make sure that the QR codes you are scanning are coming from a reputable source and that you research the destination. 

This tool can only aid but not replace.
