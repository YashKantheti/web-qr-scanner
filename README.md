This is a web-based QR scanner that can detect possible dangerous QR codes such as file downloads, and script injections. 
I'm not responsible for any failures in the detection software. This program is very basic and is by no means a foolproof method.
You should make sure that the QR codes you are scanning are coming from a reputable source and that you research the destination. 

This tool can only aid but not replace your internet responsibility. 


You can use this website: https://malqr.shielder.com to find QR codes to test this scanner.
